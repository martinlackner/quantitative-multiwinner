# quantitative-multiwinner

Python code for running the experiments in "A Quantitative Analysis of Multi-Winner Rules" by Martin Lackner and Piotr Skowron [1].

## Requirements

* Python 2.7
* [abcvoting](https://github.com/martinlackner/abcvoting) (and its prerequisites)


## Replicability

The preflib files in [preflibdata](preflibdata/) are exactly the files used in our experiments and are stored here for replicability (source: [preflib.org](http://www.preflib.org/)). Further, the experiments in the paper were done using (abcvoting v1.0.0](https://github.com/martinlackner/abcvoting/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
